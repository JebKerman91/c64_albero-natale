# Albero di Natale - Commodore 64
Minimally modified Christmas tree display for a Commodore 64, as written by my father almost 40 or so years ago.

Includes three files:
* .d64 disk image - includes the program named "albero"
* .prg program file as read from the disk image
* .txt file with the human-readable listing
